Assignment 3

# Instructions

Open the a3 project in eclipse, and modify the file in src/main/java/assignment/Assignment3.java so it complies with the instructions. Use src/test/java/assignment/Grader.java (and src/test/java/assignment/DetailedTests.java if present) to guide your testing, making sure you eventually pass the unit test.
