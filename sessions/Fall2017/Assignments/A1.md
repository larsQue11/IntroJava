Assignment 1
===

This instructions assume you have done the setup and assignment 0. Remember, the first thing to do is to **GET YOUR gitlab account**, and let me know immediately, so you can work on the assignment. 

### Submitting
Assignments are submitted by merge request on gitlab. Make sure to assign the request to me. Remember you can submit merge requests for incomplete solutions, and add your questions.


# Instructions

Modify the file in src/main/java/assignment/Assignment1.java so it complies with the instructions. Use src/main/java/test/DetailedTests.java to guide your testing, making sure you eventually pass the unit test.

# typo
```java
    public static boolean isInBetween(int number, int high, int low) {
        return number>=low && number<=high;
    }
```

The assignment requires you to modify the following simple functions:
+ isOdd - this function takes one parameter, an int and returns a boolean. It should return true if the element is odd, false otherwise.
+ sleepIn - this function takes two booleans, say, isWeekday and areWeOnVacation; it returns true if either one of its parameters (or both) is true
+ nearHundred - this function takes one int and returns a boolean; the function returns true if the number is between 10 of either 100 or 200 (so, between 90 and 110 or between 190 and 210)
+ yardsToFeet - this function takes an int, the number of yards and returns an int, the corresponding number of feet. There are 3 feet to a yard.
+triangleArea - this function takes two doubles, the base and the height of a triangle, and returns a double, its area. The area of a triangle is base times heigh divided by 2.

Notice I provide several examples. These functions only need to *RETURN* the appropriate value, and should not *print* anything (although main, or whichever function calls it may print). Feel free to modify main to do your own printing and testing; I do not grade your main.

### Navigate to project folder
```cd Documents/projects/cs5000```

### load any changes
```git checkout master```

```git pull origin master```


# Verifying and submitting

Open git-bash, and then

### Navigate to assignment folder
```cd ~/Documents/projects/cs5000/a1```   (or simply ```cd a1``` if you're already in cs5000)

### Open in eclipse and modify assignment file
in src/main/java/assignment/Assignment1.java

### Verify it works
```./gradlew grade```
If you dont get all the points, then you may want to modify until it does


### Checkout a new branch
```git checkout -b a1``` 
You may already be in this branch; if this branch already exists but you are on a different one, you may need to do ```git checkout a1```

### add and commit

```git add src/main/java/assignment/Assignment1.java```

```git commit -m "assignment 1"```
You can use the comment to specify what you did, especially if you did not finish

### push
```git push origin a1```

### submit pull request

And then follow instructions to send a pull request. Make sure to add me as a reviewer for the PR.
