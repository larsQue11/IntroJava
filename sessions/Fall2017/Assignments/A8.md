Assignment 8
===

# Instructions

Open the a8 project in eclipse, and modify the file in src/main/java/assignment/Assignment8.java so it complies with the instructions. Use src/test/java/assignment/Grader.java (and src/test/java/assignment/DetailedTests.java if present) to guide your testing, making sure you eventually pass the unit test.

Part 1 of this assignment requires you to complete the implementation of one class, GameInfo. A GameInfo instance needs to keep track of many Reviews (I provide you with the implementation of the Review class). Since this assignment is to practice arrays, you will use an array to store the Reviews for each GameInfo.

One limitation of arrays is that they cannot grow in size. One technique for dealing with this is to create an array bigger than what you need (I ask your GameInfo to be able to hold 10 Reviews), and keep an independent counter with how many elements you actually have.
